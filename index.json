With about 4 million workplace injuries annually, what we already know regarding occupational health and safety needs to continue to improve. To this purpose, the present study has three main goals; the primary goal of is to use social role theory to understand how gender affects safety-related outcomes at the workplace. The second goal of our paper is to examine how leadership styles, namely transformation and transactional leadership styles affect the relationship between gender and safety outcomes. The third and final goal of this paper is to draw on and expand Neal \u0026 Griffin’s (2004) safety framework, by specifically including gender, in combination with leadership factors, as the antecedents of safety-related outcomes in order to integrate the findings of this paper with existing safety literature. We utilized data from a large, US-based, energy company (N=3144) and conducted structural equations modeling to test the proposed conceptual model. Results showed that gender positively relates to safety priority (b = .05, SE = .02, p textless.01), indicating that women tend to have higher levels of priority of safety. In addition, safety-specific transformational leadership moderated the relationship between gender and safety priority (b = -.06, SE = .02, p textless.05), which in turn was positively related to safety behavior (b   = .35, SE = .04, p =.00). Also, safety behavior was negatively associated with accidents (b = -.29, SE = .04, p =.00) and WMSDs (b = -.19, SE = .03, p =.00). However, contingent rewards, an operationalization of transactional leadership, did not moderate the relationship between gender and safety priority (b = .03, SE = .02, ns).   Our findings have significant implications for practice and research. From a practical perspective, our results demonstrate that situation strength and strong safety transformational leadership can level the playing field between men and women’s safety priority. Thus, we suggest further interventions geared towards improving first-line supervisors transformational leadership competencies be enhanced and accelerated. Second, we encourage organizations, particularly in the energy sector, to consider including women in all positions to leverage slight advantages in safety priority, or the likelihood to pursue safety even when production pressures rise. From a theoretical perspective, our work expands on the individual difference component of prior models, providing enhanced and more nuanced perspectives on the role of demographics in the safety literature.","tags":[],"title":"How Leadership Can Reduce the Gender-Safety Priority Relationship","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lea Hellmueller","Linidita Camaj","Peggy Lindner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619637271,"objectID":"406929b9db4e534d1390429f3db33072","permalink":"/publication/hellmueller-mediating-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T19:14:31.183011Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hellmueller-mediating-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Mediating the 2020 U.S. Political Debates on Social Media: The impact of message function and visual framing on political deliberation on news outlets’ Facebook pages","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1590318000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590318000,"objectID":"8c6f881001afb7d1e58228d8223e8e69","permalink":"/talk/drcheadabovewater/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/drcheadabovewater/","section":"talk","summary":"Digital Project Management Workshop","tags":[],"title":"How to keep your head above water during a digital project","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Maryam Bagheri","Haoran Zhao","Manyang Sun","Li Huang","Srinath Madasu","Peggy Lindner","Giulia Toti"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619637268,"objectID":"d5bf854e6261104b85550735444b9592","permalink":"/publication/bagheri-data-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T19:14:28.8023Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bagheri-data-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract A new machine learning (ML)/statistical-based methodology for conditioning and predicting production data for a well pad has been developed. Typically, data conditioning involves outlier detection, missing data, data imputation, and smoothing. Time-series production data prediction can be challenging because the target (wellbore oil production) depends on large-scale, high-dimensional data sets with unknown distributions and is influenced by missing data and outliers. Hence, data conditioning is key for accurate predictions. The current work is the first attempt at using ensemble ML and statistical techniques, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector regression (SVR), for well pad data conditioning using recently disclosed subsurface and production data from a field in the southern area of the Norwegian North Sea. The time-series forecasting based on large-scale, high-dimensional conditioned and cleaned data sets is also presented. The data with an oil production rate greater than 10 Sm3 have been retained for data cleansing, which reduced the size of the production well data set by 14.9%. Outliers are detected using the z-score method. The missing values are predicted using a trained ML model on all available nonmissing data. The procedure first predicts the downhole missing values from all the wells, including the available neighboring wells, and then uses these features to predict other missing values for the well pad. In this paper, the two approaches implemented and compared for prediction of missing data are MLP and SVR, and PCA is performed to extract the most important data features. Production data with 12 related variables (i.e., dates, hours, temperature, pressure, etc.) are used to explore the complex nonlinearity of features and estimate wellbore oil production with ML and deep-learning models. Conventional SVR and MLP methods are implemented as the benchmark. During this work, more than 60% of the missing and abnormal data from the field data set are detected and imputed using advanced ML methods, such as MLP and SVR with radial basis function kernel. More than 6% of data are outliers and are removed using the z-score method. The modified SVR with time-series data structure and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms are used for the comparisons. An R-squared (R2) of 98% is achieved for both the algorithms; however, LSTM has the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) results compared to SVR. Data conditioning is conventionally performed using statistical techniques, but here, an ensemble of ML techniques is used depending on the available data. This paper presents a new methodology to perform data conditioning and production prediction for a well pad using ML and neighboring well data. The ML algorithms used are highly efficient, as demonstrated by the results.","tags":[],"title":"Data Conditioning and Forecasting Methodology using Machine Learning on Production Data for a Well Pad","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.   -- ","date":1586430000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586430000,"objectID":"55dc05480a8bd52432ac9f653fbe60e8","permalink":"/talk/dsisyrios/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/dsisyrios/","section":"talk","summary":"Making the Case for the Humanities in the Data Center","tags":[],"title":"Reconstructing Ancient Syria","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Manvi Saxena","Shweta Jha","Saba Khan","John Rodgers","Peggy Lindner","Edgar Gabriel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619637268,"objectID":"77107c5a9ae391f603b7705347324421","permalink":"/publication/saxena-comparison-2020/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T19:14:28.579987Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saxena-comparison-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of MPI and Spark for Data Science Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"/teaching/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Teaching experience","tags":null,"title":"Courses taught","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Lea Hellmueller","Valerie Hase","Peggy Lindner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619637268,"objectID":"36342d87dd7150f6032379d4614ff00c","permalink":"/publication/hellmueller-terrorism-2019/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T19:14:28.690722Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hellmueller-terrorism-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Terrorism in the News: Explaining Mediated Visibility of Organized Violence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amit Amritkar","Jerry Ebalunode","Martin Huarte-Espinosa","Peggy Lindner","Pablo Guillén Rondón","Andrea Prosperetti"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619637269,"objectID":"cd1e1edcce90ac4d1a8bc8e0d493ff6b","permalink":"/publication/amritkar-vistas-2017/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T19:14:28.990534Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amritkar-vistas-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Vistas in Advanced Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f363a287a92f20e0a52d0b905a2a3e1a","permalink":"/project/hnet/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hnet/","section":"project","summary":"A sensor data collection and analytics a framework `https://hnet.uh.edu`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"HNET Datamaps","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8c96363a3f0e579f0090bfa4cc3acc42","permalink":"/project/nasem/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nasem/","section":"project","summary":"A NASEM sponsored research project.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"Mindfulness for Offshore Safety","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A comprehensive collection of ~5600 academic scholars across 65 STEM departments at Universities across the US.

Such findings, however, have not been uniform.DESIGN/METHODS: We prospectively collected facial videos using a thermal camera (FLIR systems, FLIR SC 4000, Boston, MA, USA) from eight migraine patients during two different sessions: symptomatic (\\\"Migraine\\\") and asymptomatic (\\\"Baseline\\\"). Each recording lasted approximately 5 minutes. All patients had episodic migraine with or without aura per ICHD-2. Patients taking daily preventive medications and those with chronic migraine were excluded. Because we have two tests (supraorbital thermal signal and periorbital thermal signal) we used the Bonferroni correction for the level of significance (αc=0.05/2=0.025).RESULTS: Every subject had a significantly higher mean supraorbital temperature in the baseline session compared to the migraine session. In the two-sample t-test for each subject, the mean supraorbital response variable had significant differences between the baseline and migraine sessions, all p-values were far less than αc=0.025. In 7 out of 8 subjects the baseline session had a significantly higher mean periorbital temperature compared to the migraine session. In one subject there was no significant difference. In the two-sample t-test for each subject, the mean periorbital response variable had significant differences between the baseline and migraine sessions, all the p-values but one were far less than αc=0.025.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a characteristic facial thermal signature (supraorbital and periorbital cooling) identifies migraine headache attack presence. The mechanisms behind this thermophysiologic response require further study. We envision this thermal signature may help convey migraine presence in patients who can’t verbally communicate. In verbal patients, the thermal signature may allow identification and treatment of unsuspected migraine headache attacks early in their course before full development.Supported by: Mainly by the National Science Foundation and in small part by the Texas Medical Center and Methodist Hospital.Disclosure: Dr. Garza has received personal compensation in an editorial capacity for UpToDate, Inc and Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports.

This study explores discourse features on Facebook pages of news organizations during the 2020 U.S. primary debates using a state-of-the-art machine-learning model. Informing the scholarly debate about the implications of strategic game reporting in online spaces, we find that it is not necessarily linked to uncivil discourse, yet it might deter from relevant conversations. Second, addressing fears about the undesired outcomes of uncivil talk, our data suggest that incivility can coexist with rational discourse in user comments, although this relationship is not pervasive. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of the role of hybrid media for political engagement during electoral campaigns.

Brain-imaging-genetic studies offer great potential for understanding complex brain-related diseases/disorders of genetic etiology. Still, a combined brain-wide genome-wide analysis is difficult to perform as typical datasets fuse multiple modalities, each with high dimensionality, unique correlational landscapes, and often low statistical signal-to-noise ratios. In this review, we outline the progress in brain-imaging-genetic methodologies starting from early massive univariate to current deep learning approaches, highlighting each approach’s strengths and weaknesses and elongating it with the field’s development. We conclude by discussing selected remaining challenges and prospects for the field.","tags":[],"title":"Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis in Brain-Imaging Genetics: A Review of Methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Theo Masters-Waage","Ebenezer Edema-Sillo","Ally Gutierrez","Erika Henderson","Michelle Penn-Marshall","Juan Madera","Peggy Lindner","Cynthia Werner","Tracey Rizzuto","Christiane Spitzmueller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288164,"objectID":"fccdf7b1db3a4628d8372fb3425fa4ef","permalink":"/publication/waage-2024/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:16:04.018566Z","relpermalink":"/publication/waage-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Underrepresented Minority Faculty Face Double Standard in Promotion and Tenure Decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zihan Liu","Kevin Hoff","Erica Baranski","Galen Snyder","Rhona Flin","Peggy Lindner","Christiane Spitzmueller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1696118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288163,"objectID":"2e5881de503f8ba749799cc4cf79ffdb","permalink":"/publication/liu-mindfulness-2023/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:16:03.502292Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-mindfulness-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Mindfulness has recently gained popularity in applied settings to enhance workplace safety, especially in safety‐critical occupations such as healthcare and construction. In this review, we synthesize existing research across disciplines to establish a theoretical model of mindfulness and safety. Based on 32 empirical studies, we first summarize and critically analyze how mindfulness and safety are conceptualized and operationalized in the literature. We then consolidate empirical findings and conceptual arguments and draw upon the job demands–resources model to propose a theoretical model linking the basic benefits of mindfulness to safety‐related job demands. Specifically, we propose that mindfulness (a) improves detection of and responses to workplace risks and hazards, (b) enhances concentration and self‐monitoring of safety behaviors in cognitively demanding situations, and (c) facilitates more adaptive responses to emotional burdens. We further propose that the mindfulness–safety link can vary across boundary conditions, including personal and contextual characteristics. Our theoretical model serves as a foundation to integrate existing knowledge and guide future research. We conclude by highlighting specific opportunities for researchers and practitioners to advance research and applications of mindfulness and workplace safety.","tags":[],"title":"Mindfulness and workplace safety: An integrative review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dani Madrid-Morales","Joan Ramon Rodríguez-Amat","Peggy Lindner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288163,"objectID":"dbcd05a72cd308236fb7c2d5c10abe4e","permalink":"/publication/madrid-morales-computational-2023/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:16:03.145649Z","relpermalink":"/publication/madrid-morales-computational-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"textlessspantextgreaterTo date, the study of news deserts, geographic spaces lacking local news and information, has largely focused on countries in the Global North, particularly the United States, and has predominantly been interested in the causes and consequences of the disappearance of local media outlets (e.g., newspapers and TV stations) to the social fabric of a community. In this article, we extend the concept of “news deserts” by drawing on literature on the geography of news in Africa, where information voids have long been documented but have not been studied within the conceptual framework of news deserts. Using computational tools, we analyse a sample of 519,004 news articles published in English or French by news websites in 39 African countries. We offer evidence of the existence of online news deserts at two levels: at a continental level (i.e., some countries/regions are hardly ever covered by online media of other African countries) and at a domestic level (i.e., online news media of a given country seldom cover large areas of the said country). This article contributes to the study of news deserts by (a) examining a continent that has not been featured in previous research, (b) testing a methodological approach that employs computational tools to study news geographies online, and (c) exploring the flexibility of the term and its applicability to different media ecosystems.textless/spantextgreater","tags":[],"title":"A Computational Mapping of Online News Deserts on African News Websites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ouldooz Baghban Karimi","Giulia Toti","Mirela Gutica","Rebecca Robinson","Lisa Zhang","James H Paterson","Peggy Lindner","Michael O'Dea"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1685577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288163,"objectID":"e2c157be6a7b4bae9b1c2683347f72ca","permalink":"/publication/baghban-karimi-exploring-2023/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:16:03.344318Z","relpermalink":"/publication/baghban-karimi-exploring-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Exploring Computing Science Programs' Admission Procedures with a Diversity and Inclusion Lens","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charissa Samaniego","Peggy Lindner","Maryam A.

Adding to scholarship around structural barriers to gender equity in academic settings, we investigate the link between scholarly performance and compensation. We expect high research productivity to be differentially associated with compensation outcomes for men and women. Building on social role theory, we hypothesize that these relationships are contingent upon whether researchers are inside or outside of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Using the h-index, compensation, and researcher demographics for 3033 STEM and social and behavioral sciences (SBS) researchers from 17 R1 universities, we applied multilevel modeling techniques and showed that cumulative research productivity was more strongly related to compensation for men versus women researchers. However, these effects only held in STEM disciplines but not in SBS disciplines. Based on these results, we recommend that institutions consider changing how pay analyses are conducted and advocate for adding explicit modeling of scientific performance-compensation links as part of routine pay equity analyses.","tags":[],"title":"Higher research productivity = more pay?

With about 4 million workplace injuries annually, what we already know regarding occupational health and safety needs to continue to improve. To this purpose, the present study has three main goals; the primary goal of is to use social role theory to understand how gender affects safety-related outcomes at the workplace. The second goal of our paper is to examine how leadership styles, namely transformation and transactional leadership styles affect the relationship between gender and safety outcomes. The third and final goal of this paper is to draw on and expand Neal \u0026 Griffin’s (2004) safety framework, by specifically including gender, in combination with leadership factors, as the antecedents of safety-related outcomes in order to integrate the findings of this paper with existing safety literature. We utilized data from a large, US-based, energy company (N=3144) and conducted structural equations modeling to test the proposed conceptual model. Results showed that gender positively relates to safety priority (b = .05, SE = .02, p textless.01), indicating that women tend to have higher levels of priority of safety. In addition, safety-specific transformational leadership moderated the relationship between gender and safety priority (b = -.06, SE = .02, p textless.05), which in turn was positively related to safety behavior (b   = .35, SE = .04, p =.00). Also, safety behavior was negatively associated with accidents (b = -.29, SE = .04, p =.00) and WMSDs (b = -.19, SE = .03, p =.00). However, contingent rewards, an operationalization of transactional leadership, did not moderate the relationship between gender and safety priority (b = .03, SE = .02, ns).   Our findings have significant implications for practice and research. From a practical perspective, our results demonstrate that situation strength and strong safety transformational leadership can level the playing field between men and women’s safety priority. Thus, we suggest further interventions geared towards improving first-line supervisors transformational leadership competencies be enhanced and accelerated. Second, we encourage organizations, particularly in the energy sector, to consider including women in all positions to leverage slight advantages in safety priority, or the likelihood to pursue safety even when production pressures rise. From a theoretical perspective, our work expands on the individual difference component of prior models, providing enhanced and more nuanced perspectives on the role of demographics in the safety literature.","tags":[],"title":"How Leadership Can Reduce the Gender-Safety Priority Relationship","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1590318000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590318000,"objectID":"8c6f881001afb7d1e58228d8223e8e69","permalink":"/talk/drcheadabovewater/","publishdate":"2020-05-24T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/drcheadabovewater/","section":"talk","summary":"Digital Project Management Workshop","tags":[],"title":"How to keep your head above water during a digital project","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Maryam Bagheri","Haoran Zhao","Manyang Sun","Li Huang","Srinath Madasu","Peggy Lindner","Giulia Toti"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288160,"objectID":"d5bf854e6261104b85550735444b9592","permalink":"/publication/bagheri-data-2020/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:16:00.771414Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bagheri-data-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract A new machine learning (ML)/statistical-based methodology for conditioning and predicting production data for a well pad has been developed. Typically, data conditioning involves outlier detection, missing data, data imputation, and smoothing. Time-series production data prediction can be challenging because the target (wellbore oil production) depends on large-scale, high-dimensional data sets with unknown distributions and is influenced by missing data and outliers. Hence, data conditioning is key for accurate predictions. The current work is the first attempt at using ensemble ML and statistical techniques, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector regression (SVR), for well pad data conditioning using recently disclosed subsurface and production data from a field in the southern area of the Norwegian North Sea. The time-series forecasting based on large-scale, high-dimensional conditioned and cleaned data sets is also presented. The data with an oil production rate greater than 10 Sm3 have been retained for data cleansing, which reduced the size of the production well data set by 14.9%. Outliers are detected using the z-score method. The missing values are predicted using a trained ML model on all available nonmissing data. The procedure first predicts the downhole missing values from all the wells, including the available neighboring wells, and then uses these features to predict other missing values for the well pad. In this paper, the two approaches implemented and compared for prediction of missing data are MLP and SVR, and PCA is performed to extract the most important data features. Production data with 12 related variables (i.e., dates, hours, temperature, pressure, etc.) are used to explore the complex nonlinearity of features and estimate wellbore oil production with ML and deep-learning models. Conventional SVR and MLP methods are implemented as the benchmark. During this work, more than 60% of the missing and abnormal data from the field data set are detected and imputed using advanced ML methods, such as MLP and SVR with radial basis function kernel. More than 6% of data are outliers and are removed using the z-score method. The modified SVR with time-series data structure and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms are used for the comparisons. An R-squared (R2) of 98% is achieved for both the algorithms; however, LSTM has the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) results compared to SVR. Data conditioning is conventionally performed using statistical techniques, but here, an ensemble of ML techniques is used depending on the available data. This paper presents a new methodology to perform data conditioning and production prediction for a well pad using ML and neighboring well data. The ML algorithms used are highly efficient, as demonstrated by the results.","tags":[],"title":"Data Conditioning and Forecasting Methodology using Machine Learning on Production Data for a Well Pad","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1586430000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586430000,"objectID":"55dc05480a8bd52432ac9f653fbe60e8","permalink":"/talk/dsisyrios/","publishdate":"2020-04-09T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/dsisyrios/","section":"talk","summary":"Making the Case for the Humanities in the Data Center","tags":[],"title":"Reconstructing Ancient Syria","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Manvi Saxena","Shweta Jha","Saba Khan","John Rodgers","Peggy Lindner","Edgar Gabriel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288161,"objectID":"77107c5a9ae391f603b7705347324421","permalink":"/publication/saxena-comparison-2020/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:16:00.929269Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saxena-comparison-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of MPI and Spark for Data Science Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"322dbaccf72a6d71f827fdb2866be935","permalink":"/teaching/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/","section":"","summary":"Teaching experience","tags":null,"title":"Courses taught","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Lea Hellmueller","Valerie Hase","Peggy Lindner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288157,"objectID":"36342d87dd7150f6032379d4614ff00c","permalink":"/publication/hellmueller-terrorism-2019/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:15:57.465164Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hellmueller-terrorism-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Terrorism in the News: Explaining Mediated Visibility of Organized Violence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amit Amritkar","Jerry Ebalunode","Martin Huarte-Espinosa","Peggy Lindner","Pablo Guillén Rondón","Andrea Prosperetti"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288159,"objectID":"cd1e1edcce90ac4d1a8bc8e0d493ff6b","permalink":"/publication/amritkar-vistas-2017/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:15:59.592786Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amritkar-vistas-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Vistas in Advanced Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giulia Toti","Ricardo Vilalta","Peggy Lindner","Daniel Price"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718288160,"objectID":"b7fd0b48d7e676ee9d2854b2dd09ece2","permalink":"/publication/toti-effect-2016/","publishdate":"2024-06-13T14:15:59.938957Z","relpermalink":"/publication/toti-effect-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Effect of the Definition of Non-Exposed Population in Risk Pattern Mining","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f363a287a92f20e0a52d0b905a2a3e1a","permalink":"/project/hnet/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hnet/","section":"project","summary":"A sensor data collection and analytics a framework `https://hnet.uh.edu`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"HNET Datamaps","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8c96363a3f0e579f0090bfa4cc3acc42","permalink":"/project/nasem/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nasem/","section":"project","summary":"A NASEM sponsored research project.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"Mindfulness for Offshore Safety","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A comprehensive collection of ~5600 academic scholars across 65 STEM departments at Universities across the US.

Such findings, however, have not been uniform.DESIGN/METHODS: We prospectively collected facial videos using a thermal camera (FLIR systems, FLIR SC 4000, Boston, MA, USA) from eight migraine patients during two different sessions: symptomatic (\\\"Migraine\\\") and asymptomatic (\\\"Baseline\\\"). Each recording lasted approximately 5 minutes. All patients had episodic migraine with or without aura per ICHD-2. Patients taking daily preventive medications and those with chronic migraine were excluded. Because we have two tests (supraorbital thermal signal and periorbital thermal signal) we used the Bonferroni correction for the level of significance (αc=0.05/2=0.025).RESULTS: Every subject had a significantly higher mean supraorbital temperature in the baseline session compared to the migraine session. In the two-sample t-test for each subject, the mean supraorbital response variable had significant differences between the baseline and migraine sessions, all p-values were far less than αc=0.025. In 7 out of 8 subjects the baseline session had a significantly higher mean periorbital temperature compared to the migraine session. In one subject there was no significant difference. In the two-sample t-test for each subject, the mean periorbital response variable had significant differences between the baseline and migraine sessions, all the p-values but one were far less than αc=0.025.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a characteristic facial thermal signature (supraorbital and periorbital cooling) identifies migraine headache attack presence. The mechanisms behind this thermophysiologic response require further study. We envision this thermal signature may help convey migraine presence in patients who can’t verbally communicate. In verbal patients, the thermal signature may allow identification and treatment of unsuspected migraine headache attacks early in their course before full development.Supported by: Mainly by the National Science Foundation and in small part by the Texas Medical Center and Methodist Hospital.Disclosure: Dr. Garza has received personal compensation in an editorial capacity for UpToDate, Inc and Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports.

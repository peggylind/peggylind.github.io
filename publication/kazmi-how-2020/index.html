    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">Despite the downward trend in the occurrences of workplace deaths and injuries over the past few decades (Hofmann, Burke, &amp; Zohar, 2017), workplace safety still continues to be a significant concern to practitioners and researchers alike. With about 4 million workplace injuries annually, what we already know regarding occupational health and safety needs to continue to improve. To this purpose, the present study has three main goals; the primary goal of is to use social role theory to understand how gender affects safety-related outcomes at the workplace. The second goal of our paper is to examine how leadership styles, namely transformation and transactional leadership styles affect the relationship between gender and safety outcomes. The third and final goal of this paper is to draw on and expand Neal &amp; Griffin’s (2004) safety framework, by specifically including gender, in combination with leadership factors, as the antecedents of safety-related outcomes in order to integrate the findings of this paper with existing safety literature. We utilized data from a large, US-based, energy company (N=3144) and conducted structural equations modeling to test the proposed conceptual model. Results showed that gender positively relates to safety priority (b = .05, SE = .02, p textless.01), indicating that women tend to have higher levels of priority of safety. In addition, safety-specific transformational leadership moderated the relationship between gender and safety priority (b = -.06, SE = .02, p textless.05), which in turn was positively related to safety behavior (b   = .35, SE = .04, p =.00). Also, safety behavior was negatively associated with accidents (b = -.29, SE = .04, p =.00) and WMSDs (b = -.19, SE = .03, p =.00). However, contingent rewards, an operationalization of transactional leadership, did not moderate the relationship between gender and safety priority (b = .03, SE = .02, ns).   Our findings have significant implications for practice and research. From a practical perspective, our results demonstrate that situation strength and strong safety transformational leadership can level the playing field between men and women’s safety priority. Thus, we suggest further interventions geared towards improving first-line supervisors transformational leadership competencies be enhanced and accelerated. Second, we encourage organizations, particularly in the energy sector, to consider including women in all positions to leverage slight advantages in safety priority, or the likelihood to pursue safety even when production pressures rise. From a theoretical perspective, our work expands on the individual difference component of prior models, providing enhanced and more nuanced perspectives on the role of demographics in the safety literature.</p>
